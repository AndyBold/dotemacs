* My custom key binds
** Kill words, not characters

   backward-kill-word as alternative to Backspace:
     - Kill the entire word instead of hitting Backspace key several times. To do this will bind the =backward-kill-region= function to the =C-w= key combination

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (global-set-key "\C-w" 'backward-kill-word)
  (global-set-key "\C-x\C-k" 'kill-region)
  (global-set-key "\C-c\C-k" 'kill-region)
  #+end_src

** Align
   Align the lines in a region based on a regexp.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c =") 'align-regexp)
   #+end_src

** Toggle comments
   Toggle comments on or off for the selected region. Language aware, so you get the correct comment syntax.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c #") 'comment-or-uncomment-region)
   #+end_src

** Evaluate region
   When I'm tweaking my config I spend a lot of time calling =eval-region=.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c R") 'eval-region)
   #+end_src

** Upgrade packages
   I like the Paradox package interface, so we'll stick with that for package upgrades too.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c P") 'paradox-upgrade-packages)
   #+end_src

** Grab org-id links
   I started using [[http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/tree/lisp/org-id.el][org-id]] to link tasks in and across various org files. But I've already overridden the default keyboard shortcut for org-id-store-link and become used to using it for the other function. This brings back an alternative that works for me.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x l") 'org-id-store-link)
   #+end_src
