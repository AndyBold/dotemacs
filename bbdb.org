* BBDB
  BBDB has been the de facto Emacs contact database for a long time. I haven't relly got into using it as it doesn't fit my workflow. (Too much time spent having to use Other People's Email Services, for example.)

  Nevertheless, let's keep it loaded for now.

  #+name: bbdb-things
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package bbdb)
  (require 'bbdb)
  (use-package bbdb-ext)
  #+end_src
