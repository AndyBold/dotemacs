* Shell
  A holdover from an experiment of doing everything in Emacs.
  Didn't like it.
  But in case I ever try again, for posterity.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package company-shell)

    ;; Give ansi-term a spin...
    (defvar my-term-shell "/usr/bin/zsh")
    (defadvice ansi-term (before force-bash)
      "List shells before forcing bash."
      (interactive (list my-term-shell)))
    (ad-activate 'ansi-term)

    ;; Finished means Finished
    (defadvice term-sentinel (around my-advice-term-sentinel (proc msg))
      "Finishing."
      (if (memq (process-status proc) '(signal exit))
          (let ((buffer (process-buffer proc)))
            ad-do-it
            (kill-buffer buffer))
        ad-do-it))
    (ad-activate 'term-sentinel)

    ;; Toggle between char and line mode
    (defun term-toggle-mode ()
      "Toggle terminal mode between char and line."
      (interactive)
      (if (term-in-line-mode)
          (term-char-mode)
        (term-line-mode)))

    ;; Hooks
    (defun my-term-hook ()
      "Set up hooks for terminal mode."
      (goto-address-mode)
      (local-set-key "\C-c\C-j" 'term-toggle-mode) ;; toggle line/char mode
