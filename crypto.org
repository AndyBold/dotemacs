* Crypto
  I use Orgmode's support for GPG to ensure confidentiality of anything that I might store in a public repo. I also sometimes use 'pass', which is a password manager that uses GPG, and there's a package for that too.

  #+name: crypto-things
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (require 'epa-file)
    (when (eq system-type 'darwin)
      (custom-set-variables '(epg-gpg-program  "/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg2")))
    (when (eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
      (custom-set-variables '(epg-gpg-program  "/usr/bin/gpg2")))

    ;; Optional, if adding 'allow-emacs-pinentry' to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf doesn't help.
    ;; Note: Neither of these options work with CentOS 7
    ;; (setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)

    ;; Interact with 'pass' password store
    (use-package password-store
      :ensure t
      :defer t)

  #+end_src
