* Hydra
  Various Hydras are defined here to avoid cluttering up other files, or because there isn't a specific file for the specific Hydra. For example, there is a Projectile Hydra copied from the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Projectile][Hydra wiki]] in here. It's in here because Projectile itself is called in by =counsel-projectile= in [[ivy.org]], so it's not an obvious for for that file.
